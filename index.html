          <h3>About Campbell</h3>
          <p>
          Hello world, 
          I am Campbell and I am student of full stack software engineering at Academy Xi.
          I am embarking on a career change to software engineering. I am currently a Chartered Accountant and have been an accountant for the past 15 years.
          </p>
          <p>
          I have always had an interest in technology and a natural curiosity as to how things work under the surface. And having spent most of my working days in front of a computer since the early 2000’s (showing my age here, yikes!), and now more than ever using web-based applications, and so found a natural gravitation towards software engineering and to have a career as a software engineer.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Also, having worked with businesses in varying industries over the past 15 years I have developed the ability to identify problems and I feel I have a creative side that can conceptualize solutions. I believe that being a software engineer is the perfect career to be in to satisfy my creative and problem-solving itch. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I live in Adelaide with my beautiful wife and 2 beautiful children. I lived in many places and cities in my lifetime, both in Australia and overseas, but my home city of Adelaide always seems to draw me back.
          </p>
          <p>
          Adelaide is a small cosmopolitan beachside city with a population of approximately 1.3 million people. It has a number of world class food and wine regions which are only a short drive from the city. The city is surrounded by beautiful parklands and it feels like nature is all around. Having access to stunning beaches that are perfect for relaxing on a hot summers day. Being a mix of contemporary cosmopolitan city and old world established from the days of the early settlers of South Australia it is the perfect city to raise a family.   
          </p>
          <p>
          In recent years there has been the development of the old Royal Adelaide Hospital site into a business and technology hub which has attracted large international firms in the technology and space industry. Even with the world becoming a smaller place due to the advent of online and digital technology, Adelaide is an exciting city to be in for a budding software engineer to launch their career!
            Feel free to stop in and say “hi” if you are ever in Adelaide.
